You have chosen or been chosen to read this weird-ass documentation. Yes, you should not expect anything too serious here. It is NOT meant to be a serious documentation. Most of the text I've written here is satiric, sarcastic, because:
- I liked the style of "Motherfucking Website" therefore I wanted to make something like it myself!
- Writing of documentation is such a soul-draining task to the point when I decided to write it the weirdest way imaginable.
Maybe, just maybe my "style" is going over-the-top in some places. But the thing is? I'm pretty sure nobody will care much about it all and the only reason why I did this thing is because I want my soul to rest, knowing that 3 years of technical debt are now fully covered with documentation.

This thing was written in 3 months, I did nothing except documentation for 3 months and I'm tired of that stuff. I wouldn't call the current version of documentation final in any way, so be ready for changes.

Welcome to hell, ladies and gentlemen.
