								Like any other documentation page, this one will start with a story... So... This game didn't have a game menu for a long time... Honestly I didn't work that much with UI and it was rather frightening to make one. Either way, I decided to face the fear and actually make this game menu. I don't remember if it was my first work on UI, but if you take a look into source code and fucking tell that this is my first attempt into UI. It's a mess. It's horrible. I hate it. I want to refactor it. For some reason I still didn't do that. Maybe because I still don't give a shit about a game menu? Oh yeah sure... I can whine here as much as I'd like, but either way I write that page to be somewhat useful for you, dear reader. Mainly, this page is about telling you how to survive in that horrible mess I call a "game menu". Looks fancy outside, but don't you dare to look inside...<br>
								<br>
								Any future of "the script" are referring to <code class="gdscript">
									"res://modules/game_menu/src/ui/main_control.gd"
								</code>
								<br>
								<br>

							<h2>
								General Implementation
							</h2>
							<p>
								<br>
								<img src="../../../_guide/.images/game_menu/scene_tree0.png" width="400px" onclick="maximizeImage(this)" class="clickable-image">
									<br>
									<code class="red-marking">
										Do not repeat at home
									</code>
									<br>
									This game menu implementation is using a famous UI development pattern that is also known as "Clusterfuck of nodes". Just nodes. Nodes. Nodes... Layers after layers... <code class="gdscript">
										"res://modules/game_menu/src/ui/main_control.gd"
									</code>
									is practically just having a bunch of functions that are called by signals connected in editor while editing the scene <code class="gdscript">
										"res://modules/game_menu/assets/ui_scene/game_menu.tscn"
									</code>
									It quite literally is just a clusterfuck of nodes. If you know how to work with <code class="gdscript">
										Control
									</code>
									derived nodes and Godot UI in general, you can already do something with this game menu. However... There might be some things to point out anyway, just for ease of future editing.<br>
									<br>
								</p>
								<h2>
									Small Nodes
								</h2>
								<p>
									<br>
									There's a bunch of "small" nodes that deserve their own section here. They are called "small" due to their very simplistic functionality, like, there's nothing complex at all.<br>
									<img src="../../../_guide/.images/game_menu/scene_tree1.png" width="400px" onclick="maximizeImage(this)" class="clickable-image">
										<br>
										The following nodes I treat as "small", "simple" ones. Yes. Exactly like that. You can have your own opinion regarding this. Why wouldn't you have a different opinion about small things anyway?<br>
										<br>
										<code>
											Nodes
										</code>
										<br>
										<code class="gdscript">
											"background"
										</code>
										- A simple texture rect for background of the main menu. It's basically just vignette with video degradation effect.<br>
										<code class="gdscript">
											"background_old"
										</code>
										- An older implementation of background. Due to introduction of "Gamma Correction", I decided to "temporarily" replace it with <code class="gdscript">
											"background"
										</code>
										and as you can understand, that's one of those cases when temporary solution turned out to be permanent.<br>
										<code class="gdscript">
											"discord"
										</code>
										- A button that opens a Discord invite link to join "Index Project" Discord server.<br>
										<code class="gdscript">
											"reddit"
										</code>
										- A button that opens a Reddit page that Bender has made for lulz.<br>
										<code class="gdscript">
											"news"
										</code>
										- A button that opens a patch notes news page in game menu.<br>
										<code class="gdscript">
											"email"
										</code>
										- A button that copies an email of Index Project into clipboard.<br>
										<code class="gdscript">
											"notes"
										</code>
										- Notes by Bender himself, yeah, these are optional and can be enabled in settings of game menu. Keep in mind that "notes UI" is only made for this game menu.<br>
										<code class="gdscript">
											"email_showup"
										</code>
										- A showup panel that shows when a mouse cursor is hovering over <code class="gdscript">
											"email"
										</code>
										button, shows Index Project email.<br>
										<code class="gdscript">
											"email_copied_showup"
										</code>
										- A showup panel that shows up when an <code class="gdscript">
											"email"
										</code>
										button is clicked, it says <code class="gdscript">
											"Copied!"
										</code>
										<br>
										<code class="gdscript">
											"achievement_tooltip"
										</code>
										and <code class="gdscript">
											"save_tooltip"
										</code>
										- These are just tooltips for the corresponding menus.<br>
										<code class="gdscript">
											"fade"
										</code>
										- A simple <code class="gdscript">
											ColorRect
										</code>
										to fade the menu in/out.<br>
										<code class="gdscript">
											"confirm_window"
										</code>
										- A simple confirmation window that you can call by using a <code class="gdscript">
											show_confirm_window
										</code>
										method.<br>
										<code class="gdscript">
											"block"
										</code>
										- A simple <code class="gdscript">
											ColorRect
										</code>
										node with a fully transparent color. It blocks any mouse inputs. It is used by fading of the game menu to prevent usage of buttons. If it fades into black, it makes it impossible to click any buttons.<br>
										<br>
									</p>
									<h2>
										"items"
									</h2>
									<p>
										<br>
										It's not like items, but... buttons... Look, I'm confused here too, alright?<br>
										<img src="../../../_guide/.images/game_menu/items0.png" width="400px" onclick="maximizeImage(this)" class="clickable-image">
											<br>
											Yeah, definitely buttons. So, there's no special magical logic regarding these buttons here, you just connect a signal to <code class="gdscript">
												"main_control"
											</code>
											script and then you do whatever you want. Yeah. You just slap one more function into this fuck pile. Yeah. Absolutely.<br>
											<br>
										</p>
										<h2>
											"tab_panel"
										</h2>
										<p>
											<br>
											<img src="../../../_guide/.images/game_menu/tab_panel0.png" width="400px" onclick="maximizeImage(this)" class="clickable-image">
												<br>
												"tab_panel" is a universal solution. That already should sound pretty shitty to you. Either way, "tab_panel" serves as a way to show some kind of content in a window. For the time being, it is used for the following "panels":<br>
												- Settings<br>
												- Credits<br>
												- Achievements<br>
												- Game save loading<br>
												- OST player<br>
												- Languages selection<br>
												- Patch notes news<br>
												Every single one of those might need their own section to be described better when it comes to their general implementation.<br>

													This is the biggest clusterfuck in this whole mess. This is the reason <code class="gdscript">
														"main_control"
													</code>
													script is THAT huge. Settings. I love them, really, they give a possibility to cut the crap and make it run on potatos. It's a sweet option. Their implementation sucks ass, though, and you will have to deal with it. In this section, it is worth mentioning that:<br>
													- All that crap also just uses connection of signals to <code class="gdscript">
														"main_control"
													</code>
													making the entire disaster even worse, but hey, I hope you love Italian food.<br>
													- Ignore the line above, turns out it doesn't use it here and I'll keep the line above just because I love references to Italian food.<br>
													- That thing still turns the code of <code class="gdscript">
														"main_control"
													</code>
													into mess anyway, but it makes you feel the pain in a different, more sophisticated way.<br>
													The only reason you'd be *so interested* in this section is because you'd want to add a setting yourself. Firstly, think about it: Do you really want to add a setting? Really? Like, those settings that this game already has, isn't that *enough*? Are you sure? <code class="red-marking">
														Are you sure twice?
													</code>
													I beg you, it's not a good idea to actually add a setting in this game. Please. Don't. This didn't stop you? What kind of person you are...<br>

													How to add your own setting into this fuck pile

												<h4 style="width: 60%">
													Find a node with an option value selection that fits your needs. If one exists - it's good, you can practically keep copy-pasting shit I've wrote already. If not - it's your problem now, you will write the rest all by yourself regretting your choices.

													<h4 style="width: 60%">
														Then you just duplicate the node, rename some things in it, etc. After that go to <code class="gdscript">
															"main_control"
														</code>
														and do Ctrl + F, find the source code of the thing you duplicated before, use its name as a keyword to find out the crappy source code I wrote.

																	Graphics settings are affecting visual effects that affect GPU and *may* affect CPU as well. Some of the things these settings do aren't solely "graphical" I'd say, but since a lot of players preferred to use a graphics menu only - it is now doing more than it was designed to. Sounds like a classic story, older than anyone reading this thing.<br>
																	<code>
																		List of graphics settings

																	<br>
																	<code class="gdscript">
																		"Preset"

																	</code>
																	- Changes the game's resolution. Affects <code class="gdscript">
																		"window_resolution"
																	</code>
																	value.<br>
																	<code class="gdscript">
																		"Fullscreen"
																	</code>
																	- Changes the fullscreen mode. Fun fact: You can also use Alt + Enter for this. It isn't, like, the "real" fullscreen mode, more like so-called "windowed fullscreen mode". Affects <code class="gdscript">
																		"window_fullscreen"
																	</code>
																	value.<br>
																	<code class="gdscript">
																		"V-Sync"
																	</code>
																	- Vertical Synchronization, it says it all. Affects <code class="gdscript">
																		"vsync_enabled"
																	</code>
																	value.<br>
																	<code class="gdscript">
																		"Display"

																	- Chooses which display to use for this game. Even if it is visible, it is supposed to be useful for multidisplay setups. Affects <code class="gdscript">
																		"display"
																	</code>
																	value.<br>
																	<code class="gdscript">
																		"Field Of View"
																	</code>
																	- Regulates the player's field of view. Only regulates the camera's FOV, viewmodels are left untouched because I'm not going to tweak animations to make sure they aren't looking weird on high FOVs. Affects <code class="gdscript">
																		"FOV"
																	</code>
																	value.<br>
																	<code class="gdscript">

																		"anti_aliasing_quality"
																	</code>
																	value.<br>
																	<code class="gdscript">
																		"FXAA"
																	</code>
																	- Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing. Turns your game into a blurry mess in attempt to do anti-aliasing. Much faster than MSAA, though, so it makes sense to have it in settings. Having this option enabled doesn't mean that it'll make your game any better. Seriously. Just a blurry mess. A glorified blurry mess. Affects <code class="gdscript">
																		"fxaa_enabled"
																	</code>
																	value.<br>
																	<code class="gdscript">
																		"Color Grading"
																	</code>
																	- LUT Color Grading effect. Changes colors. You know, in a cinamatic manner. Especially when it is configured right... Either way, affects <code class="gdscript">
																		"color_grading"
																	</code>
																	value.<br>
																	<code class="gdscript">
																		"Gamma"
																	</code>
																	- Changes gamma. It's like... brightness... with extra steps... Man, can't you just use the damn setting to see it yourself? It just affects <code class="gdscript">
																		"gamma_value"
																	</code>
																	, that's all you have to know.<br>
																	<code class="gdscript">
																		"Brightness"

																		"shadow_filter_quality"
																	</code>
																	value.<br>
																	<code class="gdscript">
																		"Light Shadow Quality"
																	</code>
																	- Changes the shadow quality of all shadowmaps. This one seems to work weirdly, though. Affects <code class="gdscript">
																		"light_shadow_quality"
																	</code>
																	value.<br>
																	<code class="gdscript">
																		"Depth Quality"

																	value.<br>
																	<code class="gdscript">
																		"Overall Detailing"
																	</code>
																	- This one. This one isn't just a setting. It's a whole fucking replacement of that mess I had in a game settings. A whole damn clusterfuck of settings to change here. All of them are *basically* related to wasteful settings that can harm CPU/GPU performance severely, depending on your hardware. Affects <code class="gdscript">
																		"overall_detailing"

																	setting that is affecting <code class="gdscript">
																		"human_shooting_light", "human_footsteps", "human_battle_phrases", "human_smooth_shoot_sound", "left_hand_animation", "in_sight_animation", "viewmodel_close_surface_check", "bullet_trails", "bullet_trail_light", "env_reverb", "soundscape_random_sounds", "bullet_process_water", "bullet_process_glass", "bullet_shoot_event", "player_camera_walk_anim", "player_camera_suppression_anim", "player_camera_explosion_anim", "player_low_health_anim", "player_camera_damage_anim", "viewmodel_casings", "viewmodel_fire_light"
																	</code>
																	values.<br>
																	<code class="gdscript">
																		"Particle Quality"
																	</code>
																	- Quality of the particles, usually being a fucked up reason of GPU overdrawing that leads to even fucking worse performance. Oh yes, I know, I know about the particles being trash in performance, you easily fix that by removing them entirely. Affects <code class="gdscript">
																		"particle_quality"
																	</code>
																	value.<br>
																	<code class="gdscript">
																		"Material Quality"
																	</code>
																	- A setting that fucks up material real good. They were PBR, right? With all the fancy shit? So it basically strips down the PBR and turns it into diffuse-only materials. Fucking beautiful. It cuts down for about 30-40% of OpenGL operations. Saves your GPU. Affects <code class="gdscript">
																		"material_quality"
																	</code>
																	value.<br>
																	<code class="gdscript">
																		"Post-Processing Quality"
																	</code>
																	- Strips down post-processing effects by using their hand-written low-quality shitty version of them. Saves some shader processing, but for what reason? Don't your iGPU like reading an already existing mipmap with blurred variations of the screen? Oh, actually, it doesn't like it. Affects <code class="gdscript">
																		"post_processing_quality"
																	</code>
																	value.<br>
																	<code class="gdscript">
																		"Character Quality"
																	</code>
																	- Affects apperance of LOD version of <code class="gdscript">
																		HumanModel
																	</code>
																	if one exists for a model. On low it shows LOD variation all the time. Affects <code class="gdscript">
																		"character_quality"
																	</code>
																	value.<br>
																	<code class="gdscript">
																		"Props Amount"
																	</code>
																	- Cuts down all the fancy shit from locations in form of any location meshes (<code class="gdscript">
																		LocationProp, LocationBlockoutMesh, LocationMeshCombiner
																	</code>
																	) to make your crap run faster. Behavior of such meshes are manually configured. It's not even only about visual stuff, it also helps to cut down the physics too. Is it cruel? <code class="red-marking">
																		Yes.
																	</code>
																	Is it working? <code>
																		For fucking sure.
																	</code>
																	Affects <code class="gdscript">
																		"props_amount"
																	</code>
																	value.<br>
																	<code class="gdscript">
																		"Water Quality"
																	</code>
																	- Changes the quality of the water shader. Affects <code class="gdscript">
																		"water_quality"
																	</code>
																	value.<br>
																	<code class="gdscript">
																		"Viewmodel Hands Quality"
																	</code>
																	- Changes the quality of the viewmodel hands if one exists for the current set of viewmodel hands. Affects <code class="gdscript">
																		"viewmodel_hands_quality"
																	</code>
																	value.<br>
																	<code class="gdscript">
																		"Decal Quality"
																	</code>
																	- Changes the quality of newly created decals (blood, bullet hits, etc). On high uses projected decals (which can be a bit expensive, even though accurate), on medium it creates a simple quad (fast, inaccurate), on low it doesn't create anything (very fast and fucking disappointing). Affects <code class="gdscript">
																		"decal_quality"
																	</code>
																	value.<br>
																	<code class="gdscript">
																		"Lighting Quality"
																	</code>
																	- Changes the quality of lighting. Usually affects the amount of lights, their rendering distance, etc. Affects <code class="gdscript">
																		"lighting_quality"
																	</code>
																	value.<br>
																	<code class="gdscript">
																		"Physics Quality"
																	</code>
																	- Changes the quality of physics. It's not like it's changing anything that drastically. Mostly it is used to make static bodies detection of surfaces (which requires separate set of <code class="gdscript">
																		StaticBody
																	</code>
																	nodes) less accurate (by replacing with just one generic-typed node). Affects <code class="gdscript">
																		"physics_quality"
																	</code>
																	value.<br>
																	<code class="gdscript">
																		"Debris Amount"
																	</code>
																	- Changes the overall amount of debris. Debris is kinda impactful when it comes to physics so their amount is given to be controlled. It is possible to go beyond the limit and get your PC cooked, if you *really* want. Affects <code class="gdscript">
																		"debris_amount"
																	</code>
																	value.<br>
																	<code class="gdscript">
																		"NPC Amount"
																	</code>
																	- Controls the amount of NPCs on the location. Each NPC spawn is manually configured. On "low" it simply disables spawn of NPC spawns that are supposed to spawn on "high" settings only. Helps to drastically optimize CPU use because NPCs are unoptimized pieces of shit that I love using in huge quantities despite that. Affects <code class="gdscript">
																		"NPC_amount"

																		<br>
																		<code class="gdscript">
																			"Instant Usage"
																		</code>
																		- Instant usage. Yes yes yes. Exactly. Okay, if we take it a bit seriously... This setting works together with left-hand animations. If there are left-hand animations, used objects aren't really used immediately, but after 0.2 seconds timer, waiting for the animation to get to the state when hiding a weapon wouldn't make it look bad. It might make the game a bit less responsive and therefore become a reason for somebody to configure it to be disabled. Oh yes, sometimes I can think about others, surprisingly.

																								Yeah so... There was a button for a language menu in the "items" node, but then Bender started to complain about the sheer amount of those buttons in there, so I had to move it into settings. Sounds nice, right? You definitely needed to know about this. I know you do. Either way, the list of those languages is filled automatically by checking the list of files of those .json files in <code class="gdscript">
																									"localization"
																								</code>
																								folder. One thing that you need to know is that <code class="gdscript">
																									"__original_text.json"

																								is listed as "Runglish" and <code class="gdscript">

																								is listed as <code class="gdscript">

																										An OST menu. Might be a little excessive for this game, given the fact it doesn't really have that kind of revolutionary soundtrack that everybody would like to listen instead of playing this game. But you know? I don't really care because it was fun to work on. It is using quite a bunch of methods: <code class="gdscript">

																										contains all the soundtracks in .mp3 format. All the initialization is happening in <code class="gdscript">

																										You may notice those weird numbers in the beginning of file names. I use it as a weird way to sort the positioning in the playlist. I know, it's weird, but it works. Keep in mind that those numbers are ignored entirely and filename is used for the display naming in the menu. Oh wait, why does <code class="gdscript">

																												Start a new game yes yes yes. Alright. It might not be as easy to explain because this thing is kinda broken. Firstly, if you wonder how difficulties selection works... It's pretty simple.<br>

																														<br>
																														Tada, now you can connect dots between 2 + 2 and add your own difficulty :)<br>
																														Alright, you'd need to edit some other scripts to do that, but... It is what it is. It's not really a topic of this documentation page, so I won't cover it here, especially because I doubt that this game would need any other difficulties except those it has now.<br>
																														<br>
																														When you start a new game - you are getting redirected to a functional location that is <code class="gdscript">
																															"func_new_game"
																														</code>
																														. When you enter this location, a logic script located at <code class="gdscript">
																															"res://locations/scenes/logic/func_main_menu.gd"
																														</code>
																														will be runned and then the new game starts basically. Effectively broken modern solution for an ancient problem.<br>
																														<br>
																														I hope you had fun reading about this game menu.
