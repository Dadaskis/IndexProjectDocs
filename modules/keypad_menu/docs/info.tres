This is it, that's the point when we can turn this game into immersive-sim, oh yeah. Actually, nevermind, this may not happen.

There are 2 ways to use this thing, you either write code or you use ST.

[wc]Code[/wc]
First argument is password (as a string). Second argument is an event name when access is granted.
[gd]KeypadMenu.open(\"1337\", \"keypad_access_granted\")[/gd]

[wc]Script Toolkit[/wc]
//img:keypad_menu/example1.png
Simply use [p]st_keypad[/p]. [p]Open Event[/p] is an event that has to happen when this keypad needs to be opened (shit it's harder to write than I thought). [p]Password[/p] is the password, keep in mind there's 4 digit limit. [p]Access Event Name[/p] is an event that happens when you enter the password right."
