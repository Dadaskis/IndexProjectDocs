							<code class="gdscript">
								LocationDecalMesh
							</code>
							represents an optimized decal that can be used in huge quantities on any kinds of locations. It is using mesh instance for these (meaning accurate lighting, lower GPU overhead, etc) and combines it all together when the game starts. However, this kind of decals isn't fast to project as it is computationally expensive. It can be done fast enough, but it might not be usable for cases when you need to create a character's blood all around the place after one is getting shot (consider to use <code class="gdscript">
								LocationDecal
							</code>
							instead). Real-time creation of these isn't recommended. Their main purpose is about placing them down on locations to add additional detail using flat planes with half-transparent textures that serve as decals. In other words: Primary use of this node is creation of completely static decals.<br>

								Principle of work
							</h4>
							<p>
								<br>
								The node itself, <code class="gdscript">
									LocationDecalMesh
								</code>
								is relatively simple, it is managing some simple settings and all. It doesn't contain the projection logic, however. Projection logic is stored at <code class="gdscript">
									"res://modules/location_decal_mesh/third_party/ProjectedDecal.tscn"
								</code>
								and its related script.<br>
								<br>
								<a href="https://github.com/Miziziziz/GodotProjectedDecals">
									Decal projection code was politely stolen from here.
								</a>
								<br>
								<br>
								I'm a gentlemen after all.<br>
								<br>
								I honestly wish I could explain how exactly does it do the projection, but really... It just contains a clusterfuck of maths that I don't really understand. So, all I do, is instancing the scene to do the projection trick, get the mesh and call it a day. You should too. Lose the control. Get some questionable freedom. Please.
