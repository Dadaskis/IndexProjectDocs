						<h4>
							Description
						</h4>
						<p>
							So, let's assume that you decided to export GLTF of your location. You know, for fancies. I don't know, you suddenly have an urge to edit a scene that for some reason misses a proper .blend file that you need so damn much. There's surely a way to export GLTFs by default, you just go to <code class="gdscript">
								"Project >
								Tools >
								Export GLTF..."
							</code>
							. It exports GLTF that you need. Unicorns are vomitting rainbows outside your home. Sun light fills the room. Angels sing as you exported your GLTF. Except it is all bullshit and whenever you import GLTF you get a good pile of junk that you never asked for. Oh, if you actually succeed to export a GLTF file, last time I tried using this button it took me 52 years for this manuever just to witness what I just said.<br>
							<br>
							That is the reason why this module exists. Dumb? It sure fucking is.<br>
							<br>

							How to use?
						</h4>
						<p>
							<br>
							0. Go to <code class="gdscript">
								"res://modules/location_export_helper/assets/editor_scene/exporter.tscn"
							</code>
							, open it<br>
							1. Change <code class="gdscript">
								loc_name
							</code>
							exported property (should be called <code class="gdscript">
								"Loc Name"
							</code>
							in humane) to your desired location and press <code class="gdscript">
								export_loc
							</code>
							checkbox that also should be called <code class="gdscript">
								"Export Loc"
							</code>
							<br>
							3. Locate your freshly exported location GLTF at <code class="gdscript">
								"res://.dev_sources/exported_location_GLTF/"
							</code>
							<br>
							<br>
							It was initially made to get locations to make comics renderers, but then I realized it would make more sense to spend a good chunk of my lifetime making a program that'd automate 8 hours of repetitive painful mindfuck that additionally took too much of my drive's space.<br>
							<br>
							Take it. Hold it. Love it.
