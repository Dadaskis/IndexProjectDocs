								What's the purpose?
							</h2>
							<p>
								<br>
								Character Builder provides a solid workflow to make characters of any complexity. In fact, it works like constructor of humanoid characters. If you ever played GTA, you probably were using their dressing system at least once to change apperance of your character. In this case, Character Builder is quite similar. However, in this case, it is usable for making of character models, that later can be used for NPCs or comic scenes. In this case...<br>
								- Character Builder is providing "character parts" to add parts that have influence of multiple bones. These can be rather complex clothes or equipment.<br>
								- "Character details" are objects that are attached to a bone (100% bone weight influence on all vertices), in this case, it can be ammo rig pouches, radios, goggles, minor reusable details.<br>
								- Solid preview of a moving character to show how vertex weights are working.<br>
								- Possibility to save and return later.<br>
								- All assets can be loaded in real-time, you don't have to wait for Godot to import models or textures.<br>
								- Subtextures support and material editing for even more visual control.<br>
								- Export of GLTFs with minimal amount of materials by creation of combined, optimized texture atlas.<br>
								- Due to more modular workflow, work can be split between multiple artists working on different parts/details.<br>
								- And probably a bit more.<br>
								<br>
								<code>
									How was it made before? What was the reason to create the Character Builder?
								</code>
								<br>
								<img src="../../../_guide/.images/character_builder/old0.jpg" width="400px" onclick="maximizeImage(this)" class="clickable-image">
									<br>
									The workflow was like that:<br>
									- Create a high-poly model of clothes to combine in one mesh afterwards.<br>
									- Making a quick, dirty low-poly with Instant Meshes.<br>
									- UV unwrapping, baking, texturing, quick rigging, tada.<br>
									...<br>
									In 8 hours i could make one character! Or, not really 8 hours, sometimes more if you had to make quadruple NVGs for example. This workflow was *blazingly fast*, really. However, it was suffering from issues that were rather offputting for me as a developer:<br>
									- Each character would require at least 8 hours of work, of course, it could be less... but it would come at cost.<br>
									- There's no possibility to reuse *any* parts of already existing characters.<br>
									- Higher level of detail usually meant going through several circles of hell. Would you like to take a hellish ride?<br>
									- Hard surface modelling (forementioned NVGs) is rather complex.<br>
									- It is nearly impossible to go back and change *one little thing* in a model.<br>
									- And so on, if you have certain experience in modelling, you might mention *even more* of these points.<br>

										Purpose
									</code>
									<br>
									<img src="../../../_guide/.images/character_builder/new0.jpg" width="400px" onclick="maximizeImage(this)" class="clickable-image">
										<br>
										So that being said, Character Builder is <code>
											the must
										</code>
										when it comes to creation of any characters in this game from now on. Even if alternative ways are still available, it is <code>
											highly advised
										</code>
										to use this tool instead. It saves a lot of pain when it comes to arrangement of clothes, reusing of parts, and, surely, the most important point here is that it optimizes both worktime and runtime performance of resulting characters.<br>
										<br>
										To use this tool, simply change to location called <code>
											character_builder
										</code>
										, simple as that. Keep in mind: This location <code class="red-marking">
											WILL NOT work at exported game
										</code>
										since it is relying on GLTF exporting tools that are <code>
											only available in editor builds.
										</code>
										<br>
										<br>
									</p>
									<h2>
										Technical side
									</h2>
									<p>
										<br>
										<br>
										Firstly, you need to know that the entire editor is practically made in a single scene: <code>
											res://modules/character_builder/assets/editor_scenes/character_builder.tscn
										</code>
										. Of course, it is using a set of subscenes for more complex parts like camera controller, character, UI and gizmos.<br>

										<code>
											Scene Structure
										</code>
										<br>
										<img src="../../../_guide/.images/character_builder/scene_structure0.jpg" width="400px" onclick="maximizeImage(this)" class="clickable-image">
											<br>
											<code>
												world_env
											</code>
											and <code>
												env
											</code>
											- these two simply setup an environment to see in the background<br>
											<code>
												cam_rotation
											</code>
											-  camera controller, simple controls assigned to Right Mouse Button<br>
											<code>
												character
											</code>
											- the character themselves, represents a complex model with all character meshes of parts/details on it, it also contains the exporting logic in the code of this node<br>
											<code>
												ui_layer/editor_UI
											</code>
											- this editor's entire UI, a pretty complex subscene with all kinds of <code>
												Control
											</code>
											-derived nodes<br>
											<code>
												position
											</code>
											and <code>
												rotation
											</code>
											- gizmos used by the system to move the objects around (mainly used for details)<br>
											<code>
												screenshot_viewport
											</code>
											- just a viewport that makes screenshots for character save files<br>

												<code>
													res://modules/character_builder/assets/char_base/
												</code>
												- contains a humanoid character placeholder<br>
												<code>
													res://modules/character_builder/assets/editor_scenes/
												</code>
												- a set of folders related to the main editor scene (including the scene itself)<br>
												<code>
													res://modules/character_builder/assets/editor_scenes/character/
												</code>
												- scenes related to the character model, in this case, the character scene as well as the material exporting scene<br>
												<code>
													res://modules/character_builder/assets/editor_scenes/editor/
												</code>
												- generic editor stuff like camera controller, this folder contains <code>
													camera.tscn
												</code>
												that works like first-person noclip view, however it was made in the first version of this tool and was removed due to uncomfortable use in this scenario<br>
												<code>
													res://modules/character_builder/assets/editor_scenes/editor_UI/
												</code>
												- contains the editor UI scene as well as folder that contains variety of complex UI elements used by this editor UI, this folder also contains a theme resource file<br>
												<code>
													res://modules/character_builder/assets/editor_scenes/editor_UI/parts/
												</code>
												- complex editor UI parts, which are related to variety of lists, selectors and, the most important part - material combiner window<br>
												<code>
													res://modules/character_builder/assets/textures/
												</code>
												- some textures, used mainly by UI<br>
												<br>
												This module also contains <code>
													hidden folders
												</code>
												that will be covered in different section of this documentation.<br>
												<br>
												<code>
													Code structure and principles
												</code>
												<br>
												<br>
												Unlike some other similar modules like <code>
													comics_renderer
												</code>
												, this module is trying to utilize principle "call down, signal up" as much as possible to avoid mess in the code. Sadly it results in an insane amount of boilerplate code, but overall, organization is more or less clear. Even if i wish to tell about every script in detail, they have their very own documentation pages. Here i would like to point out the ones that are quite essential for this module, so it would be easier for you to start orienting yourself here.<br>
												<br>
												<code>
													res://modules/character_builder/src/character_builder.gd
												</code>
												- this is the primary script in this system, it works like a duct tape for character model and UI. It is connecting to all signals of these two and makes them communicate with each other though signal calls. If character model have changed the list of parts, editor UI will be updated accordingly. If material combiner menu have got some changes, character will get information about that from this primary script that'll get that info from a signal. Call down, signal up, that's the purpose of this entire script. Surely, it went beyond that when it comes to the following points:<br>
												- Input management<br>
												- UI / Camera Controller synchronization (do not accept inputs if cursor in UI)<br>
												- Object selection logic (mainly used for "character details")<br>
												- Saving/Loading logic handling<br>
												All of this logic helps to make this tool usable for the end-user; Makes them happy, you know, satisfied with this life, extra dopamine in their mind, makes them forget all the trouble they have experienced in this life, you know what i mean.<br>
												<br>
												<code>
													res://modules/character_builder/src/editor_UI/editor_UI.gd
												</code>
												- this is the editor UI's code and, yeah, there's not much to see here, it is basically a fully-fledged "call down, signal up" script that connects all the pieces together while providing a list of signals usable by the <code>
													character_builder.gd
												</code>
												<br>
												<br>
												<code>
													res://modules/character_builder/src/character/character.gd
												</code>
												- in a way, some kind of heart in this entire system. This is the code that works with the character model, which is about:<br>
												- Organizing/Processing character parts and details<br>
												- Exporting into GLTF with combined texture sets<br>
												- Working with saving/loading<br>
												Even though this script works with exporting, keep in mind: Material combiner window is the thing that makes exporting possible, only with proper configuration <code>
													character.gd
												</code>
												can function as exporter.<br>
												<br>
												<code>
													res://modules/character_builder/src/character/material_export.gd
												</code>
												- all texture sets are rendered in a separate <code>
													Viewport
												</code>
												to be combined later in <code>
													character.gd
												</code>
												. This one is important because materials might have different configurations and <code>
													material_export.gd
												</code>
												is forcing all materials to be saved in a PBR set that consists of "Diffuse", "Normal" and "MRS" maps. Keep in mind, all "texture set combining" logic is placed in <code>
													character.gd
												</code>
												, not here.<br>
												<br>
												<code>
													res://modules/character_builder/src/editor_UI/parts/material_combiner.gd
												</code>
												- code for the material combining UI. This one is important to mention, because that's the source of all info regarding the texture sets combination; It is exporting data that is later used <code>
													character.gd
												</code>
												<br>
												<br>
												<code>
													res://modules/character_builder/src/autoload/character_builder_utilities.gd
												</code>
												- an auto-load that is also known <code>
													CharacterBuilderUtilities
												</code>
												, this singleton exists to cover the essential needs of model processing in this module that is required by character parts/details as well as certain UI elements<br>
												<br>
												For more details regarding other scripts in this module, please, read documentation of these scripts or take a look at their source code.<br>
												<br>
												<code>
													Hidden Folders
												</code>
												<br>
												<img src="../../../_guide/.images/character_builder/hidden_folders0.jpg" width="400px" onclick="maximizeImage(this)" class="clickable-image">
													<br>
													<code>
														res://modules/character_builder/assets/
													</code>
													contains a set of hidden folders. Godot ignores all folders that are starting with a point, like <code>
														.game_export
													</code>
													in particular. In this case, Godot won't import any of the files in there and they won't be visible in <code>
														FileSystem
													</code>
													. Besides ignoring the importing step of this engine, there's one more reason of choosing such a design decision: This project contains a lot of files that are slowing down the work of <code>
														FileSystem
													</code>
													, resulting in much slower detection of importable files, slower saving times and etc. More than that, this system is relying on runtime loading of resources by using <code class="gdscript">
														CharacterBuilderUtilities.load_image_texture
													</code>
													and <code class="gdscript">
														PackedSceneGLTF.import_gltf_scene
													</code>
													as a way to skip the torturing part of importing Godot assets. It also allows to not close the application if you have imported a new part, you can simply reload the assets and it'll allow you to keep working on your character.<br>
													<br>
													List of hidden folders:<br>
													<code>
														.char_detail_sources
													</code>
													- contains source files related to character details, which includes Blender files as well as baked maps<br>
													<code>
														.char_details
													</code>
													- exported files of all character details that are loaded by the system to operate with<br>
													<code>
														.char_parts
													</code>
													- exported files of all character parts<br>
													<code>
														.char_parts_sources
													</code>
													- source files of character parts (like <code>
														.char_detail_sources
													</code>
													)<br>
													<code>
														.GLTF_exports
													</code>
													- all exported characters, they always end up here on export, even if you disable exporting to <code>
														human_model
													</code>
													module<br>
													<code>
														.saved_characters
													</code>
													- save files of all characters<br>
													<br>
													Potential usecase of these hidden folders is covered in section <code>
														How can you import your own assets? / Hidden Folders Organization
													</code>
													of this documentation page. Scroll down, you'll find it there.<br>

												<h2>
													How to use?
												</h2>
												<p>
													<br>
													<br>
													<code>
														Start
													</code>
													<br>
													To start using Character Builder, you can switch to location called <code>
														character_builder
													</code>
													by entering a console command: <code>
														change_location character_builder
													</code>
													. Or, alternatively, you can simply use dev-menu. Either way, once you switch to this location, you will see a default setup.<br>
													<img src="../../../_guide/.images/character_builder/use0.jpg" width="400px" onclick="maximizeImage(this)" class="clickable-image">
														<br>
														<br>
														<code>
															Name change
														</code>
														<br>
														Once you start working on a new character, you mind need to consider to change the name of your character. You can do that by pressing "Edit" button on the top panel and entering a name of your character. After you press "Apply", this will change the name of your character.<br>
														<img src="../../../_guide/.images/character_builder/use1.jpg" width="400px" onclick="maximizeImage(this)" class="clickable-image">
															<br>
															<br>
															<code>
																Saving
															</code>
															<br>
															By pressing save, you will save a character with this name. If there are existing save files with the same name - they will be automatically overriden, so be cautious.<br>
															<img src="../../../_guide/.images/character_builder/use2.jpg" width="400px" onclick="maximizeImage(this)" class="clickable-image">
																<br>
																<br>
																<code>
																	Loading
																</code>
																<br>
																You can also load all existing characters by pressing "Load" button, in menu you will be able to see the names of the existing characters as well as their previews for easier understanding of what kind of character it is.<br>
																<img src="../../../_guide/.images/character_builder/use3.jpg" width="400px" onclick="maximizeImage(this)" class="clickable-image">
																	<br>
																	<br>
																	<code>
																		Character Parts
																	</code>
																	<br>
																	When you make a new character, you might need to consider to add your first character part. You can do that by pressing "Add a character part" button on the left.<br>
																	<img src="../../../_guide/.images/character_builder/use4.jpg" width="400px" onclick="maximizeImage(this)" class="clickable-image">
																		<br>
																		After pressing this button, you will see a menu of all available character parts. You can add any character parts without any limitations if it fits your artistic view. Once you add a character part, the selection window will NOT close allowing you to add multiple parts.<br>
																		<img src="../../../_guide/.images/character_builder/use5.jpg" width="400px" onclick="maximizeImage(this)" class="clickable-image">
																			<br>
																			If you want to edit properties of your new part, you can press
																			[o]
																			button in the parts list on the left.<br>
																			<img src="../../../_guide/.images/character_builder/use6.jpg" width="400px" onclick="maximizeImage(this)" class="clickable-image">
																				<br>
																				This will give you access to transform parameters as well as to material editing. By pressing on material edit button, you will see the list of properties in the "Material Editor" window, where you can switch textures of your part or tweak the material parameters according to your taste or needs. If you don't need this part anymore, you can simply press "Remove" in the property window.<br>

																					<code>
																						Character Details
																					</code>
																					<br>
																					If you are done working with character parts of any sorts, you might wish to work with the details of this character. You can do that by adding them with "Add a character detail" button. Process is *very* similar to character parts, except there's one sufficient difference that makes character details a unique tool in the hands of artist. Unlike character parts, you can select details by simply clicking on them in Character Builder viewport. This will give you possibility to use gizmos to position and rotate these details. This way, you can add ammo pouches to your ammo rig. Keep in mind, details are attached to a specific bone (unlike parts that have multiple influences). When you select a detail, you can specify a bone group and, as it follows: A bone to attach this detail to. You can use "Toggle Idle Pose Animation" button to play a test animation to find out how your details are moving with the character.<br>

																						<code>
																							Exporting
																						</code>
																						<br>
																						Once you are done with creation of your character, you might want to export this character to import into this game as a "Human Model". However, you need to understand that this process consists of several steps. The most important ones are "Material Combining Configuration" and "BlenderFastTools Integration"<br>
																						<br>
																						<code>
																							Exporting - Material Combining Configuration
																						</code>
																						<br>
																						If you will try to export the character model straight away without configuration, you will get an error that says: <code>
																							Export error: Please, configure material combining without errors.
																						</code>
																						<br>
																						<img src="../../../_guide/.images/character_builder/use9.jpg" width="400px" onclick="maximizeImage(this)" class="clickable-image">
																							<br>
																							In this case, you need to press a button called "Material Config", it is located on the left.<br>
																							<img src="../../../_guide/.images/character_builder/use10.jpg" width="400px" onclick="maximizeImage(this)" class="clickable-image">
																								<br>
																								Once you press this button, you will see a highly-specialized nanotechnology non-AI fucking masterpiece window to place down simple quad shapes to turn them into a single combined bombastic optimized high-quality texture set.<br>
																								<img src="../../../_guide/.images/character_builder/use11.jpg" width="400px" onclick="maximizeImage(this)" class="clickable-image">
																									<br>
																									Oh yeah, i was so bored to write this thing at this point that i couldn't refuse to add some marketing buzzwords that would keep you engaged... Anyway, what i was saying is that you will open this window, it will contain a list of materials on the left.<br>
																									<img src="../../../_guide/.images/character_builder/use12.jpg" width="400px" onclick="maximizeImage(this)" class="clickable-image">
																										<br>
																										All of these materials have a checkbox, once you press a checkbox - this material will appear in the texture field.<br>
																										<img src="../../../_guide/.images/character_builder/use13.jpg" width="400px" onclick="maximizeImage(this)" class="clickable-image">
																											<br>
																											Even if you can place down one texture on top of another, keep in mind - UVs will be placed accordingly. So you should place them down to their unique spots without any overlaps. If you will have any overlaps, you will see a warning on the left. Overlaps won't stop you from exporting a model.<br>
																											<img src="../../../_guide/.images/character_builder/use14.jpg" width="400px" onclick="maximizeImage(this)" class="clickable-image">
																												<br>
																												You can tweak the size of individual material on the left by changing "x1.0" value to something else.<br>
																												<img src="../../../_guide/.images/character_builder/use15.jpg" width="400px" onclick="maximizeImage(this)" class="clickable-image">
																													<br>
																													And, if you are done with placement of your materials, you can also change "Tex. Size Limit" to change the size of the resulting texture in case if the default value can be too low for your needs. You can set the size limit to a maximum value and the system will use only the needed texture resolution instead.<br>
																													<img src="../../../_guide/.images/character_builder/use16.jpg" width="400px" onclick="maximizeImage(this)" class="clickable-image">
																														<br>
																														Once you are done with everything, you can press "Export GLTF" and it will export your model. Be aware that "Export Human Tex" checkbox exports your textures to a human model's folder that is placed at <code class="gdscript">

																																														UserSpatialUbershader
																																													</code>

																																														Diffuse Mode
																																													</code>
																																													to <code class="gdscript">
																																														"Burley"

																																															For the most characters you will need <code>
																																																Albedo
																																															</code>
																																															, <code>
																																																Normal Map
																																															</code>
																																															, <code>
																																																MRS
																																															</code>
																																															effects. Sometimes - <code>
																																																Emission
																																															</code>
																																															. All of these effects would be more than sufficient to make somewhat decent characters of any complexity. After you are done enabling effects, press <code>
																																																Force Update
																																															</code>
																																															to update shader in this material to fit the requirements of renderer.<br>
																																															<img src="../../../_guide/.images/character_builder/use34.jpg" width="400px" onclick="maximizeImage(this)" class="clickable-image">
																																																<br>
																																																After you've updated the material, you can assign textures to slots. Keep in mind - initially your material will be fully black, so do not forget to change <code>
																																																	Albedo Color
																																																</code>
																																																to be white. More than that, <code>
																																																	Normal Map Power
																																																</code>
																																																equals to <code>
																																																	0.0
																																																</code>
																																																by default, make sure to change value to <code>
																																																	1.0
																																																</code>
																																																so normal map would take full effect on lighting of this material. After all this - mr. Shitass0 should be looking fresh and clean.<br>

																																																	<br>
																																																	Alright, it is going a little bit offtopic here, since it goes out of scope of this module in its entirety... But let's be honest, you'd be more than happy to see your fancy new character on certain NPC in this game, right? So let's do this. <code class="gdscript">
																																																		"res://modules/non_playable_character/assets/characters/"
																																																	</code>
																																																	contains all NPC character configs of this game, so you can locate a class of your choice. Let's edit <code>

																																																			How can you import your own assets? / Hidden Folders Organization
																																																		</h2>
																																																		<p>
																																																			<br>
																																																			Once you got yourself on your feet and made a character of your dreams, you, most likely, will wonder how to add custom assets in this tool. It is pretty easy, however you need to be aware of the rules in this system. Firstly, you may learn faster if you examine already existing source files placed in folders <code class="gdscript">
																																																				"modules/character_builder/assets/.char_parts_sources/"
																																																			</code>
																																																			and <code class="gdscript">
																																																				"modules/character_builder/assets/.char_detail_sources/"
																																																			</code>
																																																			, as well as already exported <code class="gdscript">
																																																				"modules/character_builder/assets/.char_parts/"
																																																			</code>
																																																			and <code class="gdscript">
																																																				"modules/character_builder/assets/.char_details/"
																																																			</code>
																																																			. By examining these files, you have a good chance to see patterns all over the place and go through some kind of trip. Either way, i'm writing this guide so... I guess i would still need to explain it briefly.<br>

																																																				<code>
																																																					Character Parts Geometry
																																																				</code>
																																																				<br>
																																																				To make a proper piece of geometry for your character part, you need to get a proper "armature" in Blender first. <code class="gdscript">
																																																					"human_rig"
																																																				</code>
																																																				is a skeleton that is used by all human models and character parts. You can't create one yourself, you need to get it from somewhere else. You can easily get a skeleton by pressing "Import Human Armature" or by importing a character you'd wish to develop.<br>
																																																				<img src="../../../_guide/.images/character_builder/import1.jpg" width="400px" onclick="maximizeImage(this)" class="clickable-image">
																																																					<br>
																																																					Once you got the armature (preferrably with some kind of humanoid character geometry), you can create your character part. It's usually as easy as creating a geometry on top of the human base mesh. I would surely describe you a detailed guide on how to make models here, but i would rather assume you've got years of experience behind your back and you know how to make that stuff yourself.<br>
																																																					<img src="../../../_guide/.images/character_builder/import2.jpg" width="400px" onclick="maximizeImage(this)" class="clickable-image">
																																																						<br>
																																																						Once you are done with your model, make sure to name your mesh object <code class="gdscript">
																																																							"char_part"
																																																						</code>
																																																						, this way BlenderFastTools will detect it as exportable character part mesh. Before exporting, please, make sure you've got proper vertex weights (mesh is parented to armature and is deformed by it) and that the material's name is something you'd be able to operate with (and is unique enough to not cause any conflicts with other parts/details). It is highly recommended to call your materials just like you call your character part. If you make "armor0_m", then call your material "armor0_m", if there's multiple materials - just add a number in the end.<br>
																																																						<img src="../../../_guide/.images/character_builder/import3.jpg" width="400px" onclick="maximizeImage(this)" class="clickable-image">
																																																							<br>
																																																							After checking everything: Press <code class="gdscript">
																																																								"Export character part"
																																																							</code>
																																																							in "Character Builder" panel. This will export GLTF of your character part.<br>
																																																							<img src="../../../_guide/.images/character_builder/import4.jpg" width="400px" onclick="maximizeImage(this)" class="clickable-image">
																																																								<br>
																																																								However, you need to prepare textures. All of the exported textures must follow the following pattern:<br>
																																																								<code class="gdscript">
																																																									<br>
																																																									"
																																																									[matname]
																																																									_D.tga" # Diffuse / Color map<br>
																																																									"
																																																									[matname]
																																																									_N.tga" # Normal map<br>
																																																									"
																																																									[matname]
																																																									_MRS.tga" # Metal-Roughness-Specular packed map<br>
																																																									"
																																																									[matname]
																																																									_E.tga" # Emission map<br>
																																																								</code>
																																																								<br>
																																																								Keep your names consistent, if your material is called "armor0_m", then your image file name is going to be <code class="gdscript">
																																																									"armor0_m_D.tga"
																																																								</code>
																																																								. You save your textures in the folder of exported character part. To locate your exported character part, go to <code class="gdscript">
																																																									"modules/character_builder/assets/.char_parts/"
																																																								</code>
																																																								and find a folder with the name of your character part. Once you export all the textures in there, it should be fine, you can go to Character Builder, update assets and add your character part.<br>
																																																								<img src="../../../_guide/.images/character_builder/import5.jpg" width="400px" onclick="maximizeImage(this)" class="clickable-image">
																																																									<br>
																																																									Keep in mind, if something went wrong - do not close Character Builder, you can simply fix up the files, re-export stuff and then update assets in Character Builder.<br>
																																																									<img src="../../../_guide/.images/character_builder/import6.jpg" width="400px" onclick="maximizeImage(this)" class="clickable-image">

																																																										<br>
																																																										<code>
																																																											Character Details Geometry
																																																										</code>
																																																										<br>
																																																										It really is similar to exporting of character parts, except character details don't have to be parented to any armature to be exported, they can have any kind of origin and etc. In fact, they are just objects, like location props, except made for a character model. All principles related to textures and exporting apply here too, except you are just using <code class="gdscript">
																																																											"Export character detail"
																																																										</code>
																																																										. That's really all you need to know. For more information, please, reread.<br>
																																																										<img src="../../../_guide/.images/character_builder/import7.jpg" width="400px" onclick="maximizeImage(this)" class="clickable-image">
																																																											<br>
																																																											<br>
																																																											<code>
																																																												Subtextures
																																																											</code>
																																																											<br>
																																																											They work a lot like the textures mention up there, the "main/default" textures used for a part/detail. However, any part/detail can get a secondary set of these textures, and the amount of these sets can be indefinite. To make your own subtexture, please, create/locate <code class="gdscript">
																																																												"subtextures"
																																																											</code>
																																																											folder inside the directory of your part/detail. Then, inside, you create a folder with a following naming convention: <code class="gdscript">
																																																												"
																																																												[mat_name]
																																																												__
																																																												[subtex_name]
																																																												"
																																																											</code>
																																																											. For example: <code class="gdscript">
																																																												"armor0_m__osec"
																																																											</code>
																																																											. In this case, keep in mind, double underscore symbol marks a separation between a material name and a sub-texture-set name. Keep in mind, this system was designed even for these models that might have multiple materials, so including the material name first is always required for a proper functioning of this system. As an example you can examine the following directory: <code class="gdscript">
																																																												"modules/character_builder/assets/.char_parts/6b93_helmet_28x/subtextures/6b93_helmet__black/"
																																																											</code>
